# Svitla Exam
This is a solution for the Svitla exam.
My experienced based to apply on Svitla.
The exam provide a dataset static.
So, my solution was implement a Binary tree.
Check my code, I'm open to discuss, improve and learn.
# The Problem
Sample Dataset: 

CategoryId 	ParentCategoryId 	Name 			  Keywords 
100 			-1 				Business 			Money 
200 			-1 				Tutoring 			Teaching 
101 			100 			Accounting 			Taxes 
102 			100 			Taxation 
201 			200 			Computer 
103 			101 			Corporate Tax 
202 			201 			Operating System 
109 			101 			Small business Tax 

Write a working program which should do the following:
a. Given a category id return category name, parentCategoryId and key-word. Ensure that if
key-word is not present for the category, then the data from its parent should be
returned.

Sample Input/Output:
i. Input: 201; Output: ParentCategoryID=200, Name=Computer,
Keywords=Teaching
ii. Input: 202; Output: ParentCategoryID=201, Name=Operating System,
Keywords=Teaching
b. Given category level as parameter (say N) return the names of the categories which are
of Nâ€™th level in the hierarchy (categories with parentId -1 are at 1st level).
Sample Input/Output:
i. Input: 2; Output: 101, 102, 201
ii. Input: 3; Output: 103, 109, 202

# Requirements:

# Notes:
If you want to pass the Exam, you need to migrate this source code to .NET Framework, because the Technical evaluator doesn't have knowledge on this platform.
