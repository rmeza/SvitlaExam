# Svitla Exam
This is a solution for the Svitla exam.
My experienced based to apply on Svitla.
The exam provide a dataset static.
So, my solution was to implement a Binary tree.
Check my code, I'm open to discuss, improve and learn.
# The Question

Sample Dataset: 

|CategoryId | ParentCategoryId|    Name                 | Keywords       |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|  
|100        |   -1            |   Business              |  Money         |
|200        |   -1            |   Tutoring              |  Teaching      |
|101        |   100           |   Accounting            |  Taxes         |
|102        |   100           |   Taxation              |                |
|201        |   200           |   Computer              |                |
|103        |   101           |   Corporate Tax         |                |
|202        |   201           |   Operating System      |                |
|109        |   101           |   Small business Tax    |                |

Write a working program which should do the following:

1. a. Given a category id return category name, parentCategoryId and key-word. Ensure that if
key-word is not present for the category, then the data from its parent should be
returned.

  - Sample Input/Output:
  - i. Input: 201; Output: ParentCategoryID=200, Name=Computer,
  - Keywords=Teaching
  - ii. Input: 202; Output: ParentCategoryID=201, Name=Operating System,
  - Keywords=Teaching
2. b. Given category level as parameter (say N) return the names of the categories which are
of Nâ€™th level in the hierarchy (categories with parentId -1 are at 1st level).
  - Sample Input/Output:
  - i. Input: 2; Output: 101, 102, 201
  - ii. Input: 3; Output: 103, 109, 202

# Requirements:
- .NET Core 2.0
- C#
- VS2017

# Notes:

I didn't get a correct feedback from the recrutier. The problem never mentioned thath the Dataset could change values or add more nodes.
